          look like, from around 2014 or so.

          All of Ryanâ€™s comics are great but those two are truly phenomenal.</strong>

          This is a reimagining of the Kiwis by Beat! web site by <ExternalLink href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ryan_Armand">Ryan Armand</ExternalLink>, pieced together by <ExternalLink href="https://github.com/michaelvcolianna">Michael V. Colianna</ExternalLink>.
          In most cases, I have tried to keep the names of parts intact per appearance on the original site, whether those were errors by Ryan or otherwise.
          In some cases I had to guess, though.
          Feel free to send me a message on GitHub if you have any of the missing images, or if you have better names for some of the series/parts.

          You can <ExternalLink href="https://kiwisbybeat.netlify.com">view the original site here</ExternalLink>.

          A huge goal for this site to make the comics more accessible.
          A few have descriptions right now.
          It's a long process to add image captions, but worthwhile so <em>everyone</em> can enjoy Ryan's comics.
          If you're able to contribute some, please reach out!
          Any help is appreciated!
