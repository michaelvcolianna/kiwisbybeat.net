title: Kiwis by Beat!

- 2024 May 31: The site has been migrated from Gatsby to Astro, then updated to correct some faulty information. Plus a few missing panels for [Modern Fried Snake](/modern-fried-snake) and [Socks](/socks) were added, thanks to **essdee**.
- 2022 Nov 12: We have a Discord server now, thanks to **essdee** (of the Ribald Youth videos update). Added the note about that to the top of the page.
- 2022 Nov 1: I created Facebook & Twitter profiles! Links are in the footer. I also added captions to the short comics in [Verse & Stuff](/verse-and-stuff).
- 2022 Oct 27: As a (late) birthday present to myself, I redid the site! I moved away from a PHP-based system. I'm now using Gatsby to statically generate the site. It was a much longer labor of love than I thought it would be but I'm happy with the results.
- 2021 Nov 23: Added a "Ribald Youth Videos" page to the "Other Comics" section. Many thanks to **essdee** for those, which were on an "extra stuff" page from the original Ribald Youth site.
- 2020 Apr 21: Added an image to Socks that was sent to me by **bluffy**!
- 2020 Jan 28: Fixed some missing images in part 10 of "Great!" (They somehow didn't make it into the HTML even though they were physically present.) Thanks to the heads-up from **dijtro-echo**!
- 2019 Aug 26: Added a few extra images to Socks that were sent to me. Pulled a couple of other images in from **Evan Summers's** repository.
- 2019 Apr 13: Added a section for some incomplete/hidden comics that were sent to me.
- 2019 Mar 11: I've gotten some submissions that fill in a couple of small blanks. However, someone anonymously sent me what looks like the complete "Regarding the acquisition of hats!" children's book that Ryan made! I'll get that and the other small updates in as soon as possible!
- 2019 Mar 4: The primary goal of this site is to have a reliable hub for the various comics Ryan made until such time as he (hopefully) reappears.
