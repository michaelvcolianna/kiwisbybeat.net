title: 'Part 39'
commentary: "26/10/2006 - <a>Prints are...still... available... now</a>! I was going to have #37 available today as some people asked for it, but inexplicable problems with the files have stopped me from doing so, so it'll have to wait until next time. As for today's comic! I'll probably take the colors to it again sometime this week.Also it's an idea from a long time ago. So are a bunch of the comics I haven't drawn yet. CAUSE TO WORRY.  I really like the one for 2 weeks from now though, and 6 weeks from now I'm going to take a week off! If anyone was curious about the future. Also <a>there's a livejournal feed</a> for the comic. It has been there for a while I guess? I don't know as I didn't put there but there it is... if you have a livejournal and don't like visiting websites or using standalone RSS readers. I'm lazy and just post the comics there so you'll get none of this needless rambling... until I start adding it in?"
