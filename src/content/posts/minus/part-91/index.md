series: 1
set: 91
title: 'Part 91'
commentary: "11/10/2007 - A little late with this one. Following my normal habit, after I started a story I decided to completely redo everything. Except this time I couldn't because apparently I am out of illustration board(though I have enough half-finished strips done to last until December, I think), so instead of redoing the comics all that I could manage was to make small changes to the text. As usual, the new ideas for this story that you'll never see happen to be some of the best ideas ever. After having read them you would have been frozen in front of your computer for several weeks, feeding only on the pure quality of the strips to survive. Also, probably I'll start offering prints again two weeks from now. The end of the year is coming up and I figure that if I'm going to sell them again I should probably get it out of the way before December hits."
