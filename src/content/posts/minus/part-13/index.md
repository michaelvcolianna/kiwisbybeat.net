series: 1
set: 13
title: 'Part 13'
commentary: "04/5/2006 - Man, thirteen comics! This strip must be pretty unlucky, you know? Because of the number thirteen, right? Get it? I could have made a joke about that, but the mere concept of some joke about the number 13 and unluckiness is enough I think. Besides, thirteen is the luckiest number ever. Anyways, this is one of my favorite ideas. Or... it was when I doodled it in my notebook a few months ago. Now I am indifferent towards it! But man, the past."
