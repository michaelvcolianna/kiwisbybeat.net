series: 1
set: 41
title: 'Part 41'
commentary: "09/11/2006 - Last week's comic was touched up! As well as the one from the week before that(a little!)! As well as this week's and next weeks although those don't count since it was done before they went online. Why did I touch up those two older comics? Because I care about the quality of the strips, that's why. Why weren't they done right the first time? Because I... only care a little bit! Anyways, prints are apparently arriving next monday so if possible I'll try to get them sent out that same day."
