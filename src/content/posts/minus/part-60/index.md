title: 'Part 60'
commentary: "15/3/2007 - I'm out of illustration board! Not only am I out of illustration board, the local art store where I buy my illustration board is out of the illustration board that I buy! So no comic next week. I wasn't planning on taking any weeks off until April, but I guess fate had a different plan.  I bought the board online in bulk because that is the only way it is sold apparently, and once it arrives next week I'll have enough to last until this time next year. Unless I mistakenly ordered the wrong kind, in which case I hilariously wasted a lot of money. Oh yeah, last week I think I said I was going to talk about a bunch of crazy stuff here. If you want to know what that crazy stuff was going to be, then stay tuned for the next update!"
