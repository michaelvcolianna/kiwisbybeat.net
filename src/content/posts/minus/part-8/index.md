title: 'Part 8'
commentary: "30/3/2006 - Yeah, the eighth strip! Eighth! The... I don't know why I have this blurb space here. I should just have news stuff on the main site. Yeah. If you cannot make out what is on the tiny painting because you didn't see the close up on the main page or... you're reading this well after it was originally put up and that image isn't there anymore, then: it is a guy playing a flute while sitting on a rock! Also there: standing girl. I wish I had thought of putting up a classic painting of some kind. Well... I did, but it was some simple constructivist thing, and so I didn't. Then I forgot about the idea entirely."
