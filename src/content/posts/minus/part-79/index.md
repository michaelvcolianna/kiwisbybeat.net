set: 79
title: 'Part 79'
commentary: "19/7/2007 - Hi! I've been wondering what would happen if I announced this week that I was taking pre-orders for a minus collection, then next week said that I wasn't making the collection after all but was going to keep all of the money people sent me, and then the week after that I announced that I returned all of the money that was sent to me because people were complaining about me stealing from them. Would everyone get the joke, or would I forever be known as the jerk who tried to rob his readers? I GUESS I'LL NEVER KNOW! <a>Comic on the interweb!</a>"
