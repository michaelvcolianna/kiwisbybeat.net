title: 'Part 6'
commentary: "16/3/2006 - The sixth minus strip! It just so happens to be a continuation of the fourth! also: fifth! It also reveals some of my weaknesses in painting. I can't describe the trouble the last panel gave me. Ok, I can. But I won't. Ever. <br>also: check out this week's <a href=\"/2006-comic-revue/part-6\">comics revue</a> story, written by a friend of mine!"
