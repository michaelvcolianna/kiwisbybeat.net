title: 'Part 23'
commentary: "13/7/2006 - 23! I posted a touched up version of last week's strip on monday or so. I swear it was glowing and a lot of light colors didn't show up initially when I was scanning because I have to press the scanner lid down to remove greying on the borders. I'm using new paper now. It is much better than the stuff I was using before."
