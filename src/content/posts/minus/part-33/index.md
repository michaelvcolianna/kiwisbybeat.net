series: 1
set: 33
title: 'Part 33'
commentary: "21/9/2006 - 34! Special Bo Jackson edition! Two things at once, but they are comics and not sports. I put up these two strips because I didn't like this storyline so much so I decided to end it quickly. Wondering what I'm thinking about the next round of comics? Next week's is ok! The one after it... I like the last panel? Then there's a good one, two ok ones and the one after that I like a lot. Except I might put a different one in the place of that last one, so who knows. God? No, god doesn't know. I don't let him know what I'm doing with my comics because he has a habit of <i>stealing my ideas</i>."
