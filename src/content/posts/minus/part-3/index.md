commentary: "23/2/2006 - Man, three strips! Seems like this comic will go on forever! <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20070112205747/http://www.drunkduck.com/Friends_In_Spring/index.php?p=17163\" target=\"_blank\">This will go on forever too!</a> Comics forever! And all kids will sing all day on mountaintops; oh by the way, the comics, in their endlessness will sit in bins unread. \"We have much better things to do\", the people will have said."
