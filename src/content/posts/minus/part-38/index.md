set: 38
title: 'Part 38'
commentary: "19/10/2006 - <a>Prints are available now</a>! Not all 38... but a fraction of that. I'll be taking orders until Nov. 3rd and I should be able to ship them shortly after that. I dropped strips 15 and 16 from the list of included strips because I don't have good scans of the rest of the ant queen story. I was up most of the night trying to set up a neat store page and screwed up along the way and so the print page is sorta thrown together. I was going to put it off until next week so that I could have something better but the reality is I would have waited until next wednesday night because I am a dirty procrastinator and the results probably wouldn't be much different probably. Good night(or morning or afternoon depending - ?)"
