title: 'Part 46'
commentary: "21/12/2006 - Hey guys look I updated! Hope everyone got their prints by now. So I started working on the 2007 comic revue a few weeks ago. Except all of the short story ideas I had have become long. So instead of being around 150 pages or so, it'll be around 1000. Probably not. <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20060821070712/http://www.moderntales.com:80/comics/teachingbabyparanoia.php\" target=\"_blank\">Anyways here is the comic I am linking to this week!</a> It is about history. Apparently there are animal saints.  </a>"
