series: 1
set: 92
title: 'Part 92'
commentary: "18/10/2007 - I said I wouldn't have any more multi-comic updates but I am a liar and can't keep my word. This is more like one giant comic anyways, which is why I didn't want to spread it out over three weeks. Also ther was an addition to the last story that was supposed to go up today, but I didn't like the comic much and have no illustration board to redo it on, so it was cut. Also also: prints  will be available again starting next week and lasting till... just before thanksgiving, I  guess. also also also: I put up three comics today so I'm going to take 2 weeks off at some random point in the future."
