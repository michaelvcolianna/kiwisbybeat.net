title: 'Part 90'
commentary: "04/10/2007 - I tried touching up last week's strip but don't think it did much good. I guess it'll be redrawn from scratch if I ever get around to making a book. This week's strip is ok though, almost! Speaking of \"though, almost\" I am plugging the <a>Kid's Book Project</a>. It features a bunch of artists adding a page to a single story, and all of the proceeds will go to the Make a Wish Foundation. I thought I should wait until it was almost done before mentioning it and I think it is almost done RIGHT NOW. Also, I am one of the contributing artists.  You can see my name in the list up on the site. just look for where it says \"Ryan Armand\". That's me."
