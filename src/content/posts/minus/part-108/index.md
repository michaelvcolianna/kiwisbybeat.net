series: 1
set: 108
title: 'Part 108'
commentary: "7/2/08- Hi! I think today marks the 2 year anniversary of this site. Woo. If you happen to be in Japan, minus is on display at the Japan Media Art Festival's Exhibition of Award Winning Works at the National Art Center in Tokyo until the 17th. I am not sure of how it is being displayed exactly but it is there? <br><br>Also: the art store was still out of illustration board, so I had to order it in bulk again and have 50 pages coming in the mail hopefully before the end of this week. If it gets here next week I might have to take a week off to make time to get some new strips done. <br><br>Also also: prints will be available again two weeks from now, on the 21st.(of February... 2008)"
