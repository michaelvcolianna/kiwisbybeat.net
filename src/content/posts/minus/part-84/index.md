title: 'Part 84'
commentary: "23/8/2007 - <a>Ok I am still taking print orders!</a> The 31st will be the last day I take them. So a few weeks ago I mentioned not being able to come up with an idea for one of the strips in this story. In the end I couldn't settle on anything so I went with this idea because it would at least be interesting to draw.This update is late because I didn't actually decide what to draw until Wednesday night. Anyways! In the spirit of non-comicy illustrated storytelling, I'll link to <a>this.</a> SEE YOU AGAIN. AMANDARA KAMANDARA."
