series: 1
set: 78
title: 'Part 78'
commentary: "12/7/2007 - I used crayons for this. I do not know if there was any purpose to this comic other than to use crayons. In the middle of coloring it I came up with a much better ending that I didn't use because... I was already coloring the comic. But oh man it was a great idea. People would have read the comic and thought \"that's it, I'm not going to read any comics anymore\" because, because the comic made them go blind through its sheer brilliance."
