title: 'Part 19'
commentary: "15/6/2006 - New nib is doing fine, just like you know who.(for those that do not know who, I am referring to Larry, and shame on you). Also that is the end of the story. Also also: I'm out of completed strips again, so I'll finish some off over the weekend. I also need to find a place to scan them =\\ I also need to find a place to buy some new illustration board. None of the stores around here have the kind I use.Stupid California. Way to suck California.Way to suck."
