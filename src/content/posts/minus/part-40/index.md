series: 1
set: 40
title: 'Part 40'
commentary: "02/11/2006 - <a>Prints are still available even now! Unless now is after friday</a> in which case they aren't. Probably I will offer them again later this month after getting a few more scanned probably. Anyways I should be able to ship them sometime late next week. Thanks to everyone who ordered. So uh... yeah, strip 40 right? When I started this comic I decided to make sure the 40th comic followed the 39th, and I'm proud to say I've succeeded... also I was light on the colors again =\\ I touched up last weeks but didn't rescan it yet. I guess I'll screw with this one some more sometime this week and put them up together."
