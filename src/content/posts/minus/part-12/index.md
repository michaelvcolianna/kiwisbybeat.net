series: 1
set: 12
title: 'Part 12'
commentary: "27/4/2006 - Twelve! Twelve comics! I had come up with a clever comment to make about the number thirteen, but upon editing this file I found that I had not reached that number yet...so...so I can't use it. Also: the comics revue is finished and minus is the only comic updating on the site now. And so that box in the middle of the main page that points to the last updated comic is looking pretty useless right now. But it won't be useless in a few months probably! Yeah."
