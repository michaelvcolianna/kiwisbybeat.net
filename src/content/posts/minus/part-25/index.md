series: 1
set: 25
title: 'Part 25'
commentary: "27/7/2006 - 25! Milestone! No? It isn't? Ok, nevermind then. It's been a while since the last story so I decided to start one again earlier this week. I finished this comic thursday morning and the colors are a little light so I might touch it up later. also: I don't know how to dress old-timey people. Probably though, the women should have hats, probably."
