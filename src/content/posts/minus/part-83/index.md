series: 1
set: 83
title: 'Part 83'
commentary: "16/8/2007 - <a>Ok I am still taking print orders!</a> The mailing tubes I ordered were delayed for some reason so it's taking me longer to get the prints shipped off than it should =\\. If anyone is wondering why they are biting right into the lemons in this comic, that is... that is because they are eating them pirate style. =|"
