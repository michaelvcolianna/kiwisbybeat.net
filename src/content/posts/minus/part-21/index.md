series: 1
set: 21
title: 'Part 21'
commentary: "29/6/2006 - Yeah, 21 strips. 20 may not be a milestone number, but 21 sure is, in the land of prime numbers! Or... at least in the land of numbers that look like they should be prime  but aren't. Yeah. I was able to make the scan a little better than last weeks by putting my foot on the scanner."
