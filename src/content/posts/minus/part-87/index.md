series: 1
set: 87
title: 'Part 87'
commentary: "13/9/2007 - Up an hour later than I guessed. Still entirely uninterested in drawing comics right now. I'm thinking I'll spend the next week or so burning through a few stories that would last until November and then take a break. Sorta messed up on this one. I painted the whole thing with the lights off only to see the colors were quite different than I imagined once I remembered to put the light on near the end. Also: other stuff."
