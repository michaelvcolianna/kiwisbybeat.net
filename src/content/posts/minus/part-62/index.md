title: 'Part 62'
commentary: "05/4/2007 - This comic was almost put on the \"never go online\" list, but I screwed up the one I had planned for this week, so here it is! On the topic of prints: I've had a few people ask when they'll be available again and so I'm going to try to make them available within the next two weeks. I kept putting it off because I wanted to get decent scans of all of the comics before making them available again. But it would be pretty expensive to do so now and so I'm thinking that rather than pay to have the comics scanned every few months I'd rather save the money and get a decent 11x17 scanner.(as opposed to the very indecent one I bought before which had problems with working!) So! <a>here are the comics I already have good scans of.</a> If someone wants a print of a comic which is not on that list, then send me an email and I'll get scans of as many of those as I can next week(if no one wants anything then I'll just scan the 20s so that they'll look better), and then hopefully next month I'll be able to get the scanner and get decent scans of everything. That's it! Here's the email address:<br><img src=\"/pics/email.gif\" alt=\"Ryan's email\"><br> Ok! See you next fight!"
