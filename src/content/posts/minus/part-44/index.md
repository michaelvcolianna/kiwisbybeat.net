series: 1
set: 44
title: 'Part 44'
commentary: "30/11/2006 - <a>Prints are available... still!</a>. Until... Sunday night. In comic news we are back to terrible scans. I had a different strip planned for today, and it's inked and everything, but the story was too crammed together, so I decided to split it into two strips(it would work best as 1.5) and I had to make this one very quickly to have something for today. Yeah. Also: no comic next week! I mentioned some time ago that I was going to take a week off and I meant it! Also also: <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20070217042241/http://www.carlistheawesome.com/2006/08/carls-large-story-pg1.html\" target=\"_blank\">Here is an awesome comic</a>."
