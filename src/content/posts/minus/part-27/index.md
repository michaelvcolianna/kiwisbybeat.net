title: 'Part 27'
commentary: "10/8/2006 - 27! This is an old scan of this week's comic. It gave me more trouble than it should have, but I touched it up a bit and will put up a new scan of it tonight. edit: ok I put up the slightly slightly different one which is different(slightly). <p>IN NEWS: I'm trying to get a larger scanner so that I don't have to piece these strips together from 4 parts and wipe out any of the light shading. As soon as that happens I'll rescan the last two months worth of comics and hopefully they will look slightly better.In the very least the grey patches in the middle will disappear. Unless the scanner sucks. And it just might because it costs 1/10 of every other one its size.  But I am optimistic!<p>Also: <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20060619221925/http://surlyben.com/?cat=1\" target=\"_blank\">here is a fun short comic</a>."
