commentary: "26/4/2007 - <a><em>Prints are still available even now.</em></a> Thanks to everyone who has gotten one so far. I'll stop taking orders after the 30th. In other news, minus was nominated for an <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20070518115750/http://www.comic-con.org/cci/cci_eisners_main.shtml\" target=\"_blank\">Eisner award</a> for \"Best Digital Comic\". The other nominees in that category are <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20070526054408/http://telltalegames.com/community/comics/samandmax/issue-3\" target=blank>Sam and Max</a>, <a href=\"http://beecomix.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Bee, in \"Motel Art Improvement Service\"</a>, <a href=\"http://www.girlgeniusonline.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Girl Genius</a>, <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20070624105252/http://www.phables.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Phables</a>, and <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20070622220826/http://www.shootingwar.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Shooting War</a>. Just by chance we all happen to be on the interweb! If Konami had submitted their Metal Gear Solid digital comic it just might have been \" mostly interweb + PSP game\". I think there was a Silent Hill one too? If so, it could have been a Konami Festival. <a href=\"https://www.konami.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Konami</a>"
