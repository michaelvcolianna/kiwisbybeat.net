series: 1
set: 16
title: 'Part 16'
commentary: "25/5/2006 - Sixteen, six... so probably I have some kind of obsessive compulsion for mentioning how many strips are made each week. I'm going to put a stop to it right now. NOW. A little later. Next week, I'm just going to be all like \"...\" . Even if I come up with the best joke ever about the number seventeen(and I will) I won't mention it. You'll just have to live with never hearing the best joke ever. About a number. The actual best jokes ever you are free to hear anytime you like, courtesy of Suzie and Dave!"
