series: 1
set: 64
title: 'Part 64'
commentary: "19/4/2007 - <a><em>Prints are still available still.</em></a> Thanks to everyone who has gotten one so far. I just finished this week's comic shortly before updating the site,and probably I'll add some color to it and reupload it next week. Also! This was the strip that was supposed to go up two weeks ago. The idea has been sitting around for over a year now. Most hang around for a few months before they go online, but this one took longer because I didn't want to draw the dog. Specifically, I didn't want it to look like some strange rat-creature."
