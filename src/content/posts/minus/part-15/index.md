commentary: "18/5/2006 - Fifteen! Fifteen strips! I have nothing to say about the number fifteen, nor any of the numbers after it! Does thi mean that I will stop awkwardly mentioning the strip's number in the following updates? NO.<br><br>NO.<br><br>So there was a nice writeup in last week's <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20060612211205/http://www.paperbackreader.com/newcolumn2.php?ColumnID=108\" target=\"_blank\">Comics You Should Be Reading</a> article at <a href=\"https://www.paperbackreader.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Paperback Reader</a>. It's important, because they mentioned liking the strip for creating a \"self-contained world of wonder every week [with a beginning middle and end].\" And I thought that probably, I should make strips like that instead of getting to tied up with continuity stuff. Events happening anywhere and not particularly connected to anything like with the 2nd and 3rd ones. so I quickly came up with a few ideas and pencilled them and I was planning on putting them up starting this week. But I got a surprise assignment and didn't have time to finish one, so instead I colored today's strip which I already had inked a week ago and which is also the beginning of the longest minus sequence so far."
