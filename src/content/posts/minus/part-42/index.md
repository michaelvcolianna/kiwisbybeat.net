series: 1
set: 42
title: 'Part 42'
commentary: "16/11/2006 - Hello! Sent out the prints yesterday. Getting them all packed plus the illustrations that went with them took longer than I thought; I am sort of glad that I did not sell more as I would probably still be preparing for shipping now instead of... updating webpages? Anyways if everything goes alright everyone should get them next week and I will try to get some more scanned this weekend and maybe take some more orders.Thanks to everyone who got one, hope you like them.<a href=\"https://jonnycrossbones.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Also here is a good comic</a>."
