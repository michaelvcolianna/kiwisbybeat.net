series: 1
set: 80
title: 'Part 80'
commentary: "26/7/2007 - Look I updated the comic again. Crazy right?  I'll probably have to go over the colors again tonight and if I do then this sentence will disappear. If it doesn't disappear then that means I didn't have time and may get to it before next week's update. Um...also! I'm going to start taking orders for prints again next week. Every comic ever made ever will be available(ever)."
