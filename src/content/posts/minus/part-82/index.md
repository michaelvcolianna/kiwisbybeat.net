title: 'Part 82'
commentary: "09/8/2007 - <a>Ok I am still taking print orders... again!</a> <br><br>Also I have no idea of what I should to for next week's comic. Absolutely none. I'll probably have the comics that follow it inked and colored before I figure out what it will be. If I can't come up with anything then I'll... have some building turn into a robot right... and then... and then minus will fight the robot with her pirate ship and then... and then... well if I could finish the thought then that would mean I have an idea for next week's strip. Wait! Maybe minus could decide to rob people who are staying in a hotel <i>for their gold</i>! and there could be a scene where they(her and limp armed library-boy)  show up at someone's room and take their luggage, and then at the end up the comic when it shows them leaving the hotel they have on bellhop outfits! Apparently minus decided to change games while in the elevator or something! What a rascal, huh? Hahaha, that... that would... that would certainly... I'll think of something.  =|"
