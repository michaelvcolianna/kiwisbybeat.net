series: 1
set: 36
title: 'Part 36'
commentary: "05/10/2006 - 36! One of those numbers is twice as large as the other and that makes this week special somehow. So I'm going to be able to sell some prints of the comics......soon. Probably I will start taking pre-orders next week and ship them off before the end of the month. I only have good scans of a few of the comics(strips #4-6 and strips #10-15) so I'll only be able to offer those and perhaps a few illustrations from the main page in the beginning but I'll try to get clean scans of the rest at some point."
