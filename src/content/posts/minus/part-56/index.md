series: 1
set: 56
title: 'Part 56'
commentary: "01/3/2007 - Got the paints on Tuesday and was able to get today's comic done. I had to rush it maybe, but rushing is what you do when you really care about the overall quality of your creative work. As you can probably tell, this is the beginning of a story, after I finished coming up with the idea and queued up the first strip for this week, I suddenly decided to change a bunch of things around. It was hard making things work and the pacing was thrown off a bit so I decided to update with two strips next week to cover for that.  Then I probably take a week off in April to get the time back, and that's that! INTERWEB COMICS!"
