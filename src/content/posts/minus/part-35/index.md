series: 1
set: 35
title: 'Part 35'
commentary: "28/9/2006 - 35!I came up with an alternate ending for this one after I pencilled it. I didn't use it though, because... this one was already pencilled in, and... it would have taken a while to erase it and spend five minutes drawing something else. Just another example of my committment to bringing you, <b>THE READERS</b>, the best comic I can week after week!"
