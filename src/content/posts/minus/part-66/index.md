title: 'Part 66'
commentary: "03/5/2007 - <em>Prints are no longer available!</em>. Thanks again for ordering them if you did, I'll try to get them all out by sometime next week. Probably I will be able to buy a new scanner later this month too, probably. This week there are three comics because I did not like this sequence very much! Thankfully I do like the next story that's coming. ANYWAYS! Because I can't keep throwing up a bunch of comics at once like this, I'm taking next week off. Also: I'm going to take the last week of this month off too. Also also: I'm going to take a week off in June because I still have one left over from the dishface update. Also also also: nothing! Wait, I have not linked to another comic in a while but look, <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20061202084004/http://www.north-world.com/pages/book1/chp1/bk01pg000.htm\" target=\"_blank\">I am doing it right now</a>."
