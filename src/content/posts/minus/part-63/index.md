title: 'Part 63'
commentary: "12/4/2007 - <a><em>Prints are available again.</em></a> Look, I made that text slightly larger than... this text. I got new scans of all of the strips in the 20s as well as strips 53 and 62. I also reuploaded them here so check them out, they should look slightly better now.  I'm going to be taking orders for the rest of the month, after that I'll maybe try to make them available more often maybe.<br><br> In other news, a new comic has joined Koala Wallop, the webcomic club for online comics which I am in. That comic is <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20070627102352/http://riceboy.jho-tan.com/see/001.html\" target=\"_blank\">Rice Boy</a>. It is about a young apprentice at a sushi restaurant. Join him as he struggles to become a great chef, and marvel as he tries to figure out what kind of rice is used in the shop he works in! Will he realize that it is actually a mix of two very different kinds of rice!? No! Because the comic isn't about an apprentice sushi chef, but something else entirely. To find out what probably you should read it? See you again."
