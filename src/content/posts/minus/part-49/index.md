series: 1
set: 49
title: 'Part 49'
commentary: "11/1/2006 - Look the story is done. Probably the ending worked a lot better when it was just a one strip idea probably. Anyways,check out this excellent <a href=\"/pics/chalkdrawing.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">chalk rendition</a> of one of minus's illustrations I received from a Tony. You just might remember it from the 4th strip. Or maybe not because it was not in that one. On the topic of illustrations, I did some recently for <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20070326061425/http://www.landofnu.net/f/killwind.htm\" target=\"_blank\">this site</a> which houses a collection of short stories and the like. That link goes to one I liked in particular. That's it I think? Next week is comic #50! Do I have something planned for that day? YOU BET! STAY TUNED TO FIND OUT WHAT! TUNED BECAUSE THIS IS A TV STATION AND IF YOU DON'T KEEP YOUR EYES STUCK ON THIS SITE FOR THE ENTIRE WEEK UNTIL IT UPDATES AGAIN YOU <b>JUST MIGHT MISS IT</b>."
