series: 1
set: 24
title: 'Part 24'
commentary: "20/7/2006 - 24! Like the show! There's some other show I'm watching now where a guy keeps renting DVDs of \"25\". I thought it was funny because I am stupid. Also I think I saw Ice Cube on one of the DVD covers. It's 5 am and I almost forgot I had a site to update. I've been trying to come up with ideas that use less panels. Probably I will have to try harder. Anyways, some stuff: I have joined a webcomic collective, apparently? I will say more about that once it starts up proper I guess? Also, that silly business I mentioned a few weeks ago about no new comics until next year. I changed my mind and will definitely start putting one up next month. It'll update once a month with 20 or so pages, I'll be able to swing it.<br><br>Finally, <a href=\"https://www.barnaclepress.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Barnacle Press</a> - an excellent site full of old comic strips. maybe my favorite site on the interweb. READ ALL OF THE COMICS THERE. TWICE."
