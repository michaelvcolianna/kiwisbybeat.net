For those that don't know, Larry comics are comics where someone wonders about how Larry is doing, and then you find out if he is doing fine or not doing fine at all. Create your own!Also <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20070121175900/http://www.horribleville.com:80/\" target=\"_blank\">here's a fun comic.</a> It is by a <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20070120045008/http://www.rumblo.com/\" target=\"_blank\">KC Green</a>, whose \"what is a Larry comic?\" question way back in 2003 started the chain of events which led to this very day. That's all for now! See you next fight."
