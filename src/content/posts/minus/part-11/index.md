series: 1
set: 11
title: 'Part 11'
commentary: "20/4/2006 - Eleven comics. Eleven. I didn't make a million over the week, but I did make 4, which is like a million in that it is also a number. I also touched up last weeks comic. I also decided that the comic I originally planned for next week was pretty crap after I finished inking it.If...if like, I had waited until next week to draw it, I probably would have thought \"heythisisprettygood!\" or something. But it's inked and everything. If there are more cases like that maybe I'll have a \"win the comics I started drawing but didn't like!\" contest."
