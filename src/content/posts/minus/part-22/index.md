series: 1
set: 22
title: 'Part 22'
commentary: "06/7/2006 - 22! Man, five months I guess? So when I started I had no idea as to how long I'd be able to keep the strip going but it's easier than I expected so even if it ends suddenly, suddenly won't be this year, probably. I also ran out of strips again so I have to get to work on them immediately and take a break from drawing other comics. Hey Wesley, I started working on the white plains comic again today, after almost a year almost. Hey... are you reading this? I killed ten men yesterday and you cannot say I was wrong.I killed them for eating too much bread and then I wrote a song.I called it \"An ode to ten dead men\", I made it for my band. Our lead guitarist isn't up to snuff, so I hope you'll lend a hand!"
