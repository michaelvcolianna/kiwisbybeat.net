series: 1
set: 117
title: 'Part 117'
commentary: "12/4/08- This comic is late. I redrew it on Wednesday night, and starting coloring it on Thursday but instead of putting it up that night I saw that it wasn't good enough, so I said \"HEY! What's more important? Meeting some deadline... FOR THE INTERNET <b>OR MAKING THIS THE BEST DAMN COMIC STRIP I CAN!</b>\" And I went with making it the best damn strip I could, because the overall quality of this comic is what really matters and if I just threw up crap to meet deadlines I couldn't forgive myself... is what I wanted to say, but this comic is actually late because I decided to read the last few volumes of Yawara! instead of coloring it."
