Ryan's notes from this series:

> Violence SalaryMan Teppei. Made on a whim after I heard about <a href="http://www.ryanestrada.com/" target="_blank">Ryan Estrada's</a> 168 hour comic. I wanted to see what I would get if I casually made a 168 hour comic and didn't spend more time drawing it than I've been spending working on other comics over a given week. This was the result! Teppei... is violence!

To all appearances, this comic appears to be complete.
