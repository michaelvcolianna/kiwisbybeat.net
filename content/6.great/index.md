## Ryan's notes from this series:

> Originally planned to be a short goofy comic that I could put up while working on other stuff, but it ended up ballooning into a long goofy comic took time away from working on other stuff. There's a lesson there somewhere.

To all appearances, this comic appears to be complete.
