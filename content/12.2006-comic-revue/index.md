## Ryan's notes from this series:

> It's a collection of odd short comics I decided to make after finishing my old webcomic because I wasn't sure of where I wanted to go exactly with the next longterm project, but felt like I had to do something.It will update with a new complete story/chapter every tuesday until it is complete.Hope you enjoy it maybe. The comics were collected into a book which if you would like to buy that would be neat.

To all appearances, this comic appears to be complete.
